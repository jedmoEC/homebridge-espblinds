# homebridge-espblinds

### What is it?

**homebridge-espblinds** is a smartblinds management plugin for homebridge using esp32 nodeMCUs to control your **analog blinds** with relays. It was slighty modified from a version of the smartblinds accessory [Click here](https://github.com/Nicnl/homebridge-minimal-http-blinds)

The features:
- You can control your analog blinds or windowopeners.
- The control is not a simple binary open/close: **it supports percentages**. You can open your blinds at 50% or 65% for instance.
- Blinds can still be operated with buttons, if arduinocode supports it.

### Who is it for?

People who doesn't want to pay hundreds of a given currency to control their blinds via digital devices.
